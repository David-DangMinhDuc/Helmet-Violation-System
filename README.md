# Helmet violation system with YOLOv11 and easyOCR
This is a self-project, which is started from March 2025. In this project, I trained YOLOv11 model to detect person (people) who wear helmet or not + license plate + motorcycle (or other vehicles). Then, I utilized EasyOCR to recognize cropped license plate (I can preprocess license plate if I want). Currently, I develope a real-time helmet violation system using FastAPI.
